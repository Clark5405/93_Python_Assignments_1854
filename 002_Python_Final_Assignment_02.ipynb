    "\n",
    "Write a python program to create a Hangman game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About Game:**\n",
    "Going back to our old school days, some of the pen-paper games were always a top for our leisure time. In Hangman user has to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper 😉).\n",
    "In the game of Hangman, the player only has 7 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms, hang) before they lose the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "1. In Part 1, you will require to load a random word from a **[dictionary](https://github.com/milaan9/92_Python_Assignments/blob/main/sowpods.txt)**.\n",
    "2. In Part 2, you will require the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing part 1 and part 2 you will need to add the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "* Only let the user guess 7 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left. Example: \"You have 6 guesses left!\"\n",
    "* No restriction in uppercase and lowercase letters.\n",
    "    - Example: user can guess \"a\" and it will be equal to \"A\" or vice-versa.\n",
    "* If user guesses a numbers or a special characters, don’t penalize them - ask them again to choose only letter.\n",
    "    - Example: user guess \"9\" or \"?\" then ask user again to choose a letter.\n",
    "* If the guess letter appear more than one time in the word display it. \n",
    "    - Example: Word is \"Apple\" and user guess the word 'p' so  -->     __ P  P  __  __\n",
    "* Keep track of the letters the user guessed incorrectly. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, don’t penalize them - let them guess again.\n",
    "* Display some picture art for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!\n",
    "* When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game."
